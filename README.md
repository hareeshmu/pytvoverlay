## Setting up development environment

The easiest way to start, is by opening a CodeSpace here on GitHub, or by using
the [Dev Container][devcontainer] feature of Visual Studio Code.

[![Open in Dev Containers][devcontainer-shield]][devcontainer]

This Python project is fully managed using the [Poetry][poetry] dependency
manager. But also relies on the use of NodeJS for certain checks during
development.

You need at least:

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry][poetry-install]
- NodeJS 18+ (including NPM)

To install all packages, including all development requirements:

```bash
npm install
poetry install
```

As this repository uses the [pre-commit][pre-commit] framework, all changes
are linted and tested with each commit. You can run all checks and tests
manually, using the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

To run just the Python tests:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
